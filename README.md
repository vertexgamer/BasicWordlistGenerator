A simple single-threaded wordlist generator written in C++ for WINDOWS, that combines up to 12 words together with the possibility of adding a word in front.

To mix different words together you will need to create (in the same folder as the executable) a new file called: wordlist.txt
In wordlist.txt you will insert each word in their own line.
Then run BasicWordlistGenerator, choose which options suits you best and wordlist_output.txt will be created, enjoy
